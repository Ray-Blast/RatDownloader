# Rat Downloader (!!!)

## What is Rat Downloader?
Are you tired of weird downloading gizmos or doodads that want to steal your information,
pay a subscription fee, secretly stalk you, or all of tthe above?

Have you tried looking into FREE and OPEN-SOURCE solutions but found it either too complicated or too much effort?

#### Well look no further for I AM HERE

## What Rat Downloader Does:

- Makes it easier to download files such as videos, pictures, galleries, or even sets of shit
- Free alternative to giving away monies to big corpos (cringe!)
